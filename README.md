# ALPR--Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition
This repository uses openALPR to locate the license plate in each frame and to detect the moving vehicle license plate number.
This product uses the ALPR open source package to detect the license plate and track the plate number. The moving vehicle is tracked &  segmented from the background to narrow down the search region of ALPR. The code is written in python and easy to use in windows & Linux but tested with windows only.
